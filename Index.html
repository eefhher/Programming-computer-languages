        <h3>JavaScript</h3>

            Number of jobs: 24,000
            
            Average annual salary: $118,000
            
            Benefits: JavaScript is the most popular programming language for building interactive websites; “virtually everyone is using it,” Gorton says.<br> When combined with Node.js, programmers can use JavaScript to produce web content on the server before a page is sent to the browser, which can be used to build games and communication applications that run directly in the browser. A wide variety of add-ons extend the functionality of JavaScript as well. 
            
            Drawbacks: Internet browsers can disable JavaScript code from running, as JavaScript is used to code pop-up ads that in some cases can contain malicious<br> content. 
            
            Common uses: JavaScript is used extensively in website and mobile application development. Node.js allows for the development of browser-based applications,<br> which do not require users to download an application.</p></strong>

                Average annual salary: $120,000
                
                Benefits: Python is widely regarded as a programming language that’s easy to learn, due to its simple syntax, a large library of standards and toolkits,<br> and integration with other popular programming languages such as C and C++. In fact, it’s the first language that students learn in the Align program, Gorton says. “You can cover a lot of computer science concepts quickly, and it’s relatively easy to build on.” It is a popular programming language, especially among startups, and therefore Python skills are in high demand.
                
                Drawbacks: Python is not suitable for mobile application development.
                
                Common uses: Python is used in a wide variety of applications, including artificial intelligence, financial services, and data science. Social media sites<br> such as Instagram and Pinterest are also built on Python.</p></strong>

       <h3>What’s programming</h3>
       <p style="text-align: center;"><strong> Programming Language Should You Learn?

    Some programmers are able to build a career out of being an expert in one language, but many programmers new languages frequently,
 Gorton says. It’s not uncommon for a professional programmer to be fluent in three or four different languages, he adds.
        
    The type of software you want to develop is one consideration for which programming languages to learn.
     While there are no concrete rules for what language is used to write what software, a few trends offer some guidance: 
        
          Web-based startups are more likely to be programming in Python and JavaScript.
          Larger companies tend to develop their internal software applications using C# or Java and their Web applications using PHP.
        Programs for data analytics typically use the R and MATLAB programming languages.
        Embedded devices, such as those in the automotive and healthcare industries, run software written in C, C++, or Rust.
                    Applications that run on the cloud are increasingly written in Go or Scala.  
            Mobile applications are increasingly written in Swift or Kotlin.
        
    If you’re looking to start a career in programming, the Master of Science in Computer Science Align program at Northeastern
     can help you develop expertise and fluency with the popular programming languages that align with your skills and interests.
     <p><strong> of computer programming languages

        Today, there are hundreds of different programming languages. The following section contains an index of the different programming
         and scripting languages currently listed on our site. Clicking any of the following languages displays an explanation and examples
         of that language.
